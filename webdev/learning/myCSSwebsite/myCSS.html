            <p>The great kings of the Falax region decided, against the will of the people, to go to war against the island trolls. With only 2 fortnights to the first march, soldiers are hard pressed to complete their civilian tasks before being sent away for several years.</p>

            <p>The island trolls have inhabited the nearby settlements across Pasal Bay. They have been plotting the downfall of the humans long since the first trolls settled as refuges from The Rippling.</p>
